ROS for LabVIEW(TM) Software
----------------------------------

This is a set of VIs for communicating with ROS applications. Developed at Tufts University by the Mechanical Engineering Department and the Center for Engineering Education and Outreach.

If installing from github: ROS for LabVIEW Software, which is the folder located within the download, should be installed in your "LabVIEW 20XX > user.lib" folder (Under Applications > National Instruments in Mac OS X and Program Files x86 >National Instruments in Windows). LabVIEW will need to restart after installing the library.

Required Software and Settings
==============================
Use of ROS for LabVIEW Software requires LabVIEW 2012 or later and VIPM 2014 or later (if installing through LabVIEW and not github).

ROS for LabVIEW Software can be run on Windows and Mac OS. Linux platforms have not been tested.

Use of ROS for LabVIEW Software with the myRIO or roboRIO requires Windows, LabVIEW 2013 or later, LabVIEW myRIO toolkit, and LabVIEW Real-Time Module.

Use of ROS for LabVIEW Software with the roboRIO requires Windows, LabVIEW 2014 or later, LabVIEW roboRIO toolkit, and LabVIEW Real-Time Module.

If you are running LabVIEW on a Virtual Machine, you may have to change your network settings to Bridge.

Use with myRIO and roboRIO
==========================
Sample templates for myRIO and roboRIO have been developed and can be found in the Examples folder. Additional information is located in the Help folder.

Use with Baxter Research Robot
==============================
This package has been developed with the use of Baxter Research Robot. Much of his functionality has already been implemented and can be found in the devices folder.

Tutorials and Help
==================
Several videos and written tutorials are located in the Help folder. They explain how ROS for LabVIEW Software works as well as how to build your own messages, use the Terminal for debugging, etc.

Clearpath Robotics has written a tutorial on how to install and use ROS for LabVIEW software, available at this link: https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/ros/ROSforLabVIEW.html.
